<h1>Ruby Scripts</h1>

<p>In this project, you are building <em>command-line</em> Ruby programs, rather than web pages.</p>

<p>So there's nothing to do in the browser. Open a Terminal tab and try <code>rails hi</code> at the prompt.</p>

<p>(You can visit the URL <a href="/git">/git</a> in your browser to <a href="https://guides.firstdraft.com/using-git-to-freely-experiment-and-never-lose-work" target="_blank">save versions of your work using Git</a>, however.)</p>
